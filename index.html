<section id="Introduction">
	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>My name is Fabian, and I'm currently a fourth-year Computer Science major attending Illinois Tech. Throughout my entire educational career, I've 
	had a strong passion for the ever expanding industry of technology. What started off as a childish hobby in playing video games and tinkering with 
	computers quickly turned into my devotion to the exciting prospects of modern technology from the latest computer hardware to ongoing research in artificial intelligence.</p>
	<p>My hobbies expand just beyond coding and computers. I also have many interests in video editing, writing fiction, and reading various types of 
	literature, ranging from science fiction to graphic novels, all from different parts of the world.</p>
	<p>Below will be several projects I've worked on in several high school and university level courses. Above you can also read a blog about my time 
	with Scarlet Data Studio contributing towards the TransitHealth project.</p>

	<h4 class="Project">FIRST Illinois Website</h4>
	<p>As a part of being in the FIRST Illinois Robotics IPRO at Illinois Tech, I became a member of the Marketing team whose responsibility
	became analyzing and improving the marketability of FIRST Illinois Robotics. A large part of this dealt with the organization's website, which
	was previously considered outdated, clunky, and not very user-friendly. As such, our group worked alongside FIRST volunteers to drastically improve
	the User Experience and Accessability of the website as whole, giving it a fresh coat of paint along the way.</p>

	<p>As a part of one of my selected courses, I spent several months developing a series of Android apps that performed various functions. These ranged
	from note-taking or tip-calculating, to fully functional and mostly open-source Weather Forecast and News Aggregation apps.</p>
