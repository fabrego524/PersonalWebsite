<section id="Introduction">
	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>My name is Fabian, and I'm currently a third-year Computer Science major attending Illinois Tech. Throughout my entire educational career, I've had a strong passion for the ever expanding industry of technology. What started off as a childish hobby in playing video games and tinkering with computers quickly turned into my devotion to the exciting prospects of modern technology from the latest computer hardware to ongoing research in artificial intelligence.</p>
	<p>My hobbies expand just beyond coding and computers. I also have many interests in video editing, writing fiction, and reading various types of literature, ranging from science fiction to graphic novels, all from different parts of the world.</p>
	<p>Below will be several projects I've worked on in several high school and university level courses</p>
